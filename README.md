# EightPuzzle
Designed and implemented an eight-puzzle tile solver that employed state-space search algorithms, including BFS, DFS, greedy search, and A*. Featuring a user-friendly interface for puzzle input and visualization. I effectively represented puzzle states, boards, and search algorithms using object-oriented programming.
